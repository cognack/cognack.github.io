```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

library(tidyverse)

```


```{r}
ggplot(data <- diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = price))

```


When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
