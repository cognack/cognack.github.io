Can also combine in food processor or immersion blender.\r\n3-6 cloves garlic (minced)\r\n1-2 tbs ginger (minced)\r\n1/2 onion (minced)\r\n2-4 tbs gojuchang- fermented chili paste\r\n2-3 tbs hot pepper flakes (not red pepper flakes)\r\n3-5 tbs fish sauce\r\n2-3 tbs dried shrimp (grinded)(optional)\r\nSteps\r\nWash and cut up cabbage. Combine with 3-4 tbs of salt in large mixing bowl. Use another large bowl (weighted) to press on top. Wait 2-3hrs. Rinse cabbage with fresh water. Keep a portion of the excess salty cabbage water.\r\nPrepare Mixture\r\nDrain cabbage liquid. Keep for later. Wash cabbage with fresh water!!\r\nCombine drained cabbage and Mixture via deep tissue massage. Make sure everything is coated.\r\nBegin canning using wide-mouth jars. Pack tightly such that no large air pockets remain. Top with excess cabbage liquid.\r\nSeal somewhat tightly and place in dark space. Contents will off-gas and liquid will likely spill out so best to keep a plate or bowl underneath just in case.\r\nFigure 1. pH of Kimchi Fermentation Over Time, Source: Rhee, Sook & Lee, Jang & Lee, Cherl-Ho.
