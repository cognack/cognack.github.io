## MEDS Capstone

The [MEDS capstone project](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science/meds-capstone-projects) is the cornerstone of the [Master of Environmental Data Science program](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) at Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UCSB. The capstone project pairs students in teams 2-4 to tackle real-world environmental problems using open-data science practices and principles. As a graduate of the program, these projects allow us to showcase our data science chops while managing all stages of a data-driven project. As if your are you own consultant offering your services, students handle all client communication (and expectations), timelines, deliverables, product & project updates, and communicating that science to technical and non-technical audiences.
