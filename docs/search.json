There I grew my interests in sustainable agriculture, wetland conservation, and the impacts of climate change on the environment and ecosystem services. In June 2022, I graduated from UCSB‚Äôs Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program. For my capstone, I created an open-source pipeline for remote sensing of crop yields, with Zambia as a case study.\nProfessional\nBefore the MEDS program, I worked in environmental consulting as a scientist, otherwise known as a jack-of-all-trades (i.e., biologist, wetland scientist, environmental analyst, environmental planner, water quality specialist, construction monitor, etc.). I was in these roles for around six years. I managed ecological restoration projects, prepared a litany of environmental permitting and planning reports, and carried out rare and invasive plant monitoring.\nPersonal\nI‚Äôm an east coast transplant from Lowell, Massachusetts, living in beautiful Santa Barbara, California. I love to kitesurf ü™ÅüèÑ‚Äç, cook üë®‚Äçüç≥, botanize üåø, read and learn new things üìö, play soccer ‚öΩ, hike around ü•æ, and bike around üö≤.\n\nContact\nInterested in connecting? Feel free to contact me by email, Twitter, or LinkedIn. I‚Äôm open to work opportunities and look forward to hearing from you!\n\n\n\n\n",
