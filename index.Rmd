#### Welcome to my website!

<font size="4"> I'm a recent graduate in the [Master of Environmental Data Science](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) program at the Bren School at the University of California Santa Barbara. I previously worked as a biologist/scientist in environmental consulting focusing on environmental compliance, permitting, and water resources management. Feel free to look around my website to check and see what I've been up to lately.</font>
